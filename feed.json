Drummer is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner\">outliner</a> that has been especially adapted to doing blogging. If you are into either outliners or blogs, this is an interesting development. Dave is probably the oldest name in outline, blogging, and podcasting applications. You can check out his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer\">Wikipedia page</a> for a full history.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not very familiar with the history of outliners and blogging, but I do know in certain circles, especially the Mac community, early blogs were based on outlines. Over the years it seems like those two have drifted apart into their own applications and communities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"personal-interest\">Personal Interest</h2>\n\n<p>I stumbled into the blogging world long before I had heard of blogs. In the very early 2000’s personal blogs weren’t very well known, but sites like <a href=\"https://slashdot.org\">Slashdot</a> were. Slashdot was what we would now refer to as a link blog. A link blog is one that links to external articles and provides commentary about them. I decided I wanted my own link blog and so I built one based on the (at the time) open source Jive forum software. The site itself never turned into anything, but it got me my first Java consulting gig.</p>\n\n<p>Like many people I eventually drifted away from blogs into the world of social platforms. I eventually got interested in doing Apple platform development and started looking for a good open source application to work on. I found <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com\">NetNewsWire</a>. I originally began work on NetNewsWire because the code was a good model to learn advanced techniques from.

				"content_text": "\n\n## The Oldest and Newest Thing in Blogging\n\n[Dave Winer](http://scripting.com) just release a new project called [Drummer](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml). Drummer is an [outliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner) that has been especially adapted to doing blogging. If you are into either outliners or blogs, this is an interesting development. Dave is probably the oldest name in outline, blogging, and podcasting applications. You can check out his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer) for a full history.\n\nI’m not very familiar with the history of outliners and blogging, but I do know in certain circles, especially the Mac community, early blogs were based on outlines. Over the years it seems like those two have drifted apart into their own applications and communities.\n\n## Personal Interest\n\nI stumbled into the blogging world long before I had heard of blogs. In the very early 2000’s personal blogs weren’t very well known, but sites like [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org) were. Slashdot was what we would now refer to as a link blog. A link blog is one that links to external articles and provides commentary about them. I decided I wanted my own link blog and so I built one based on the (at the time) open source Jive forum software. The site itself never turned into anything, but it got me my first Java consulting gig.\n\nLike many people I eventually drifted away from blogs into the world of social platforms. I eventually got interested in doing Apple platform development and started looking for a good open source application to work on. I found [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com). I originally began work on NetNewsWire because the code was a good model to learn advanced techniques from. Along the way I rediscovered how amazing blogging is.\n\nThrough [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com), the founder of NetNewsWire, I learned about how useful outliners could be. I was familiar with outliners, but hadn’t used them to their full potential. I got more and more interested in outliners and eventually began work on [Zavala](https://zavala.vincode.io). Through Brent, I also learned about publishing outlines as blogs.\n\n## Outlines as Blogs\n\nI’ve always used outlines to do my writing since I learned about them. The hierarchal structure in writing just made sense to me. As a software consultant, I alway wrote using Word’s outline view. To me it was just natural to want to use something like that for blogs. When I heard about the history of using outlines for blogging, things just clicked.\n\nAs part of Zavala 2.0, I wanted to satisfy the blog using an outline use case. In fact, this blog post is written using Zavala.\n![](https://vincode.io/uploads/2021/a9c6cbe926.png)￼\nTo publish this outline, I run a Shortcut that uploads images and HTML to my [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) blog. Drummer works somewhat differently. Zavala considers an outline a document that gets uploaded as a post. Drummer is designed to group multiple entries under a published date. Each entry is a separate blog post, but are all grouped together by date. It also has a publish step, but what happens, happens behind the scenes.\n\n![](https://vincode.io/uploads/2021/328aa1ad88.png)￼\nIt is important here to point out some terminology differences. A “note” in Zavala is associated with a row. It provides additional detail for the topic. When publishing docs or blog posts from Zavala a topic is a group heading and a note is paragraph text.\n\nA “note” in Drummer is a row that is a blog entry. I’m not sure what makes a “note” row different than a regular row under a date. They seem to publish the same, but the icon is different some how.\n\nDrummer has the concept of a microblog post, which Zavala doesn’t have. This is similar to what you see on Micro.blog or Twitter. It is a short post that doesn’t have a title. If you add a child row under a row that is under a date, you get a full blog post where the child rows are paragraphs and the row is the blog title.\n\nDrummer’s take on blogging is a little bit different different than the common definition. I think Drummer is set up well for a prolific writer or someone who posts a lot in smaller chunks through out the day. It scales up well for long posts or quick posts just to express an opinion as well through.\n\n## What’s next\n\nIf I’ve sold you on blogging using outlines, check out this [nice article on blogging with Drummer](https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/16/getting-started-blogging.html). You will eventually be able to do blogging on some platforms with Zavala 2.0, but that won’t be ready until early 2022. In the meantime, Drummer is something to try.\n\nSome caveats about Drummer though. You will have to think differently if you are used to common forms of blogging.

Shortcuts has something called The <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/shortcuts/apd4618db957/ios\">Content Graph engine</a> which can convert data to different types on the fly, so using typed data isn’t as verbose as it could be. For example, you could pass an array of URL’s to an action that only accepts a single URL. Shortcuts will automatically pick the first (usually the only) item in the array without having to specify it. Or you could pass a URL to an action that takes a Text input and Shortcuts will change it to a text input.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"shortcomings\">Shortcomings</h2>\n\n<p>In iOS 15 and macOS 12, the Shortcut editor is buggy.

It&rsquo;s a modern take on a traditional outliner app.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is a pretty decent app, considering it was developed by a single person over 8 months. It isn&rsquo;t easy making an app that runs on 3 different platforms and does syncing and collaboration across those platforms. To give credit where due, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without some recent enhancements to Apple&rsquo;s API&rsquo;s. Catalyst and CloudKit are big advantages that I have that developers 5 years ago didn&rsquo;t have. Check out the full feature list <a href=\"https://zavala.vincode.io/features/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I am particularly proud of is how the UI is animated. Adding and removing rows isn&rsquo;t jarring and gives a solid feel to the application. For example if you are collaborating on an outline with another user, if they insert a row, the outline opens where the row goes and puts it there. There is never a situation where everything just blinks and stuff is in different locations.</p>\n\n<p>The next version, 1.1, will support images embedded into the text of the outline. It will also support some other commands that other outliners usually support. I&rsquo;ll be adding keyboard shortcuts for moving a row up or down in the outline. I&rsquo;ll also be adding a way to add rows below, either indented or outdented. I hope to have this release out by Fall.</p>\n\n<p>Version 2 will be coming much later and will require macOS 12 and iOS 15. This is so that I can take advantage the latest in automation API&rsquo;s. With Shortcuts now on the Mac, the path forward for automation on Apple&rsquo;s platforms is clear. I plan to make Zavala&rsquo;s Shortcuts capabilities very robust so that custom workflows and integration with other apps is first class. I&rsquo;m very excited to see how users automate Zavala in the future.</p>\n\n<p>If you are into outliners, you should give Zavala a try. It is free and Open Source and will be forever, so you have nothing to lose. If you are into task managers or note taking you should give outliners a try.

				"content_text": "### Update\n\nI thought I’d let people know what I’ve been working on lately. I’ve been keeping busy!\n\n### NetNewsWire 6.0\n\nMy main project that I’ve been working on for the last couple years is [NetNewsWire.](https://netnewswire.com) This project is amazing to work on. The community that [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com) has created is great. The popularity of NetNewsWire is great too. It really helps get you motivated when so many people benefit from and appreciate your work.\n\nFor the 6.0 release cycle I did the Big Sur UI refresh, iCloud syncing, and the Reddit and Twitter extensions. I also finished up the work that another developer had started on the Reader API code. That got us BazQux, The Old Reader, Inoreader, and FreshRSS syncing. I did some other small things for 6.0 too, like the Share Extension.\n\nLots of other developers contributed to 6.0 including in big ways like implementing NewsBlur syncing and other UI changes. NetNewsWire 6 is a big deal for the team. I hope you check it out and give it a try.\n\n### Feed Spider\n\nThis project has been on hold for about 6 months.

The net effect of this I estimate to be, more categories and fewer category labels per article.</p>\n\n<p>I ran the processes needed up to the supervised training.

I&rsquo;m impressed with how responsive macOS stays while under that kind of load.  If all I wanted to do was some light work, I could just let it run.  What I really wanted to do was do bugfixing on NetNewsWire while it ran.

After doing some superficial research, I decided to give Amazon&rsquo;s new ARM CPU&rsquo;s a go.  They have the best price to performance ratio and since everything I&rsquo;m doing is open source, I can compile it to ARM just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The first machine I picked out was a 16 CPU instance.  I got everything set up and started the supervised training.  It was going to take 10 hours.  Not good enough, so I detached the volume associated with the instance so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to set up and compile everything again.  I attached the volume to a 64 CPU instance and tried again.  10 hours to run.

Instead I got NaN exceptions from fastText.  Rather than dig through the fastText code to find the problem, I took a shot in the dark and started with 48 threads.  That worked and had an ETA of 3 hours.  A 48 CPU instance is the next step down for Amazon&rsquo;s new ARM CPU instances, so that is where I&rsquo;ve settled in for my on demand instance.</p>\n\n<p>As a sidebar, I would like to point out that this is a pretty good deal for me.  The 48 CPU instance is $1.85/per hour to run.  I&rsquo;m not sure how to compare apple-to-apples with a workstation, but to get to a 40 thread CPU workstation at Dell is around $5k.  Since, I&rsquo;m primarily an Apple platforms developer, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any use for it besides doing machine learning.  It would mostly be sitting idle and depreciating in value.  I would have to more than 2500 hours of processing to get ahead by buying a workstation.  That&rsquo;s assuming that a 5k workstation is as fast as the 48 CPU on demand instance, which I doubt it is.</p>\n\n<p>After 3 hours, the model came out 70% accurate against the validation file.

See the &ldquo;Pizza Arbitrage&rdquo; above.  The categories that it does find, kind of make sense?  The categories are trash for categorizing a blog though.</p>\n\n<p>One of my assumptions when starting this project was that Wikipedia&rsquo;s categories would be useful for doing supervised training.  I really don&rsquo;t know if that is the case.  How things are categorized in Wikipedia is chaotic and subjective.  You can tell that just from browsing them yourself on the web.  My hopes that machine learning would find useful patterns in them is mostly gone.</p>\n\n<p>It is time for a change in direction.  Up until this point, I had hoped to get by with a superficial understanding of Natural Language Processing and data science.  I can see know that won&rsquo;t be enough.  I&rsquo;m going to have to dig in and understand the tools I am playing with better as well as think about finding a new way of getting a trained model to categorize blogs.</p>\n",

Here is One Foot Tsunami again.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/ec9e25b8b1.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 05 26 at 10 31 25 AM\" title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 10.31.25 AM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"306\" />\n\nThe new model simply doesn't find any suggestions lots of time.  See the \"Pizza Arbitrage\" above.  The categories that it does find, kind of make sense?  The categories are trash for categorizing a blog though.\n\nOne of my assumptions when starting this project was that Wikipedia's categories would be useful for doing supervised training.  I really don't know if that is the case.  How things are categorized in Wikipedia is chaotic and subjective.  You can tell that just from browsing them yourself on the web.  My hopes that machine learning would find useful patterns in them is mostly gone.\n\nIt is time for a change in direction.  Up until this point, I had hoped to get by with a superficial understanding of Natural Language Processing and data science.  I can see know that won't be enough.  I'm going to have to dig in and understand the tools I am playing with better as well as think about finding a new way of getting a trained model to categorize blogs.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday, I had just gotten the categories and category relationships loaded into the relational database and identified the categories I want to use for blogs.  The next step was rolling up all the hundreds of thousands of categories into those roughly 1300 categories.</p>\n\n<p>I came up with a query that I thought would work.  This isn&rsquo;t easy because Wikipedia&rsquo;s categories aren&rsquo;t strictly hierarchal.  They kind of are, but it is really more of a graph than a hierarchy.  What I mean by this is that a specific article can have multiple top level categories and there are many paths to get there.  You can see this if you click on one of the categories at the bottom of a Wikipedia article.  It will take you to a page about that category and at the bottom of that page is more categories that this one belongs to.  Since there are more than one, the path to the top isn&rsquo;t obvious and is plural.</p>\n\n<p>One pitfall to walking a graph like this is getting stuck in a loop.  For example category A points to category B, which points to category C, which points to category A.  Another problem is getting back to too many top level categories.  Finally, you have to deal with the sheer number of paths that can be taken.  Say the category we are looking for has 5 parent categories and those have 5 each and those have 5 each.  That&rsquo;s 125 paths to search after only going up 3 levels.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I put code in to limit recursion, limited to 5 resulting categories, and only 4 levels of searching upwards.  The query still takes about 700ms to run which is very slow.  That is not good.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/fe9a2c1d0d.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 05 20 at 4 26 50 PM\" title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-20 at 4.26.50 PM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"154\" /></p>\n\n<p>When building a complex system it is important to address architectural risk as early as possible.  I&rsquo;m sure you have heard stories of projects getting cancelled after spending months or even years of development.  Lots of times this is because a critical piece of the architecture proved unviable late in the project.  Tragically a lot of work has usually been done that relied on that piece before discovering that it won&rsquo;t work.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest piece of architectural risk in this system is the machine learning parts.  We want to get to that as quickly as possible so that we don&rsquo;t end up doing work that may end up being thrown away. So I decided to move on to building the Article Extractor instead of optimizing the query or even trying to make it more accurate.  We can come back to it later after risk has been addressed.</p>\n\n<p>The Article Extractor being very similar to the Category Extractor didn&rsquo;t take long to code and test.  Its job is to read in the Wikipedia dumps for an article, assign the roll-up categories, and write it out to a file.  Since it relied on the slow query for part of its logic, I knew it would be slow.  So I fired up 9 instances of the Article Extractor and let it run for about 14 hours.</p>\n\n<p>When I finally checked the output of the Article Extractor it had produced only 68,000 records.  That isn&rsquo;t very much, but should be enough for us to move on to the next step.  We can go back and generate more data later if this doesn&rsquo;t prove sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>The next step is to prepare <a href=\"https://fasttext.cc\">fastText</a> to do some blog classifications by training the model.  I don&rsquo;t know much of anything about fastText yet.  I&rsquo;ve bought a book on it, but haven&rsquo;t read it.  To keep things moving along, I adapted their <a href=\"https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html\">tutorial</a> to work with the data produced thus far.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote the Article Cleaner, see <a href=\"https://vincode.io/2020/05/15/feed-spider-part.html\">flowchart</a>, as a shell script.  It combines the multiple output files from the Article Extractor processes, runs it through some data normalization routines, and spits the result 80/20 into two separate files.  The bigger file is used to train the model and the smaller to validate it.</p>\n\n<p>Supervised training came next.

				"content_text": "Yesterday, I had just gotten the categories and category relationships loaded into the relational database and identified the categories I want to use for blogs.  The next step was rolling up all the hundreds of thousands of categories into those roughly 1300 categories.\n\nI came up with a query that I thought would work.  This isn't easy because Wikipedia's categories aren't strictly hierarchal.  They kind of are, but it is really more of a graph than a hierarchy.  What I mean by this is that a specific article can have multiple top level categories and there are many paths to get there.  You can see this if you click on one of the categories at the bottom of a Wikipedia article.  It will take you to a page about that category and at the bottom of that page is more categories that this one belongs to.  Since there are more than one, the path to the top isn't obvious and is plural.\n\nOne pitfall to walking a graph like this is getting stuck in a loop.  For example category A points to category B, which points to category C, which points to category A.  Another problem is getting back to too many top level categories.  Finally, you have to deal with the sheer number of paths that can be taken.  Say the category we are looking for has 5 parent categories and those have 5 each and those have 5 each.  That's 125 paths to search after only going up 3 levels.\n\nIn the end I put code in to limit recursion, limited to 5 resulting categories, and only 4 levels of searching upwards.  The query still takes about 700ms to run which is very slow.  That is not good.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/fe9a2c1d0d.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 05 20 at 4 26 50 PM\" title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-20 at 4.26.50 PM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"154\" />\n\nWhen building a complex system it is important to address architectural risk as early as possible.  I'm sure you have heard stories of projects getting cancelled after spending months or even years of development.  Lots of times this is because a critical piece of the architecture proved unviable late in the project.  Tragically a lot of work has usually been done that relied on that piece before discovering that it won't work.\n\nThe biggest piece of architectural risk in this system is the machine learning parts.  We want to get to that as quickly as possible so that we don't end up doing work that may end up being thrown away. So I decided to move on to building the Article Extractor instead of optimizing the query or even trying to make it more accurate.  We can come back to it later after risk has been addressed.\n\nThe Article Extractor being very similar to the Category Extractor didn't take long to code and test.  Its job is to read in the Wikipedia dumps for an article, assign the roll-up categories, and write it out to a file.  Since it relied on the slow query for part of its logic, I knew it would be slow.  So I fired up 9 instances of the Article Extractor and let it run for about 14 hours.\n\nWhen I finally checked the output of the Article Extractor it had produced only 68,000 records.  That isn't very much, but should be enough for us to move on to the next step.  We can go back and generate more data later if this doesn't prove sufficient.\n\nThe next step is to prepare [fastText](https://fasttext.cc) to do some blog classifications by training the model.  I don't know much of anything about fastText yet.  I've bought a book on it, but haven't read it.  To keep things moving along, I adapted their [tutorial](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html) to work with the data produced thus far.\n\nI wrote the Article Cleaner, see [flowchart](https://vincode.io/2020/05/15/feed-spider-part.html), as a shell script.  It combines the multiple output files from the Article Extractor processes, runs it through some data normalization routines, and spits the result 80/20 into two separate files.  The bigger file is used to train the model and the smaller to validate it.\n\nSupervised training came next.  I fed fastText some parameters that I don't understand fully, but come from the tutorial, and validated the model.  I was quite shocked when the whole thing ran in under 3 minutes.  The fastText developers weren't false when naming the project.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/8e08232d40.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 05 20 at 5 11 21 PM\" title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-20 at 5.11.21 PM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"596\" height=\"134\" />\n\nThe numbers are hard to read, but what they are saying is that we are 88% accurate at predicting the correct categories for the Wikipedia articles fed to it for verification.

What are those categories?  Wikipedia supplies us with categories associated with an article.  The problem is that these categories are hierarchical.  Categories can have categories.  There are also multiple categories assigned to an article.  There are probably thousands of categories in Wikipedia.  We will need to roll up the category hierarchy and reduce the number of categories used.</p>\n\n<p>To do so, we will extract the categories used in Wikipedia and load them into a relational database using a new process called Category Extractor.  We can then do some data analysis using SQL to get a rough idea of the what the top level categories are and how many articles are under them.  Once we understand the data better, we should be able to come up with a criteria for tagging high value categories.  A process called Category Valuator will be run against the database to identify and tag the high value categories we want to extract articles for.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"training-data\">Training Data</h4>\n\n<p>The Article Extractor process will scan Wikipedia for articles that have the categories that we are looking for.  Initially we will pull 100 articles per category and increase that number as needed for the training file.  An additional 10% of the records will be pulled in a separate file to use to test the model.  The output records will be formatted for use by fastText.  Each record will have one or more categories (or labels) associated with the article text.</p>\n\n<p>Training models work better on clean data.  For example, capitalization and punctuation can degrade fastText results.  We will preprocess the data in an Article Cleaner process.</p>\n\n<p>The clean data will be passed into fastText to train the classifier model.  The test file will be used to validate the training model.  Training parameters will be tweaked here to improve accuracy while maintaining reasonable performance.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"rss-feeds\">RSS Feeds</h4>\n\n<p>Eventually we will seed our RSS Web Crawler process with the Alexa Top 1 Million Domains.  Initially however, we will probably test by crawling a blog hosting site like Blogger.  We should filter out RSS feeds by downloading them and checking last posted date and content length.  This will favor blogs that post full article content over summary blogs.  This is necessary so that we have enough content to make a category (label) prediction about the feed.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-database\">Feed Database</h4>\n\n<p>Our Labeled Feed Database will be generated by the RSS Prediction Processor.  This process will call out to fastText to get a prediction of which categories match the RSS feed.  It will also extract RSS feed metadata.  This information will be combined to generate an output database of labeled (categorized) feed information.</p>\n\n<p>The database should allow for being used as a way to browse by category (label).  It should also allow for full text searching of Feed title and/or category.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"search-results\">Search Results</h4>\n\n<p>The Labeled Feed Database should be able to be embedded in a client application.  An RSS Reader is a prime example of where this could be used.  A user interface should allow users to search the database, find feeds, and subscribe to them.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n\n<p>This high level overview should give you an idea of what we will build and how much work is involved.  There is room for improvement.  For example, the Labeled Feed Database is just a text search / browsing database.  There might be something we could do with Machine Learning to better match search criteria with the labeled feeds.</p>\n\n<p>Now on to implementing, iterating, and learning.</p>\n",

There are also multiple categories assigned to an article.  There are probably thousands of categories in Wikipedia.  We will need to roll up the category hierarchy and reduce the number of categories used.\n\nTo do so, we will extract the categories used in Wikipedia and load them into a relational database using a new process called Category Extractor.  We can then do some data analysis using SQL to get a rough idea of the what the top level categories are and how many articles are under them.  Once we understand the data better, we should be able to come up with a criteria for tagging high value categories.  A process called Category Valuator will be run against the database to identify and tag the high value categories we want to extract articles for.\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe Article Extractor process will scan Wikipedia for articles that have the categories that we are looking for.  Initially we will pull 100 articles per category and increase that number as needed for the training file.  An additional 10% of the records will be pulled in a separate file to use to test the model.  The output records will be formatted for use by fastText.  Each record will have one or more categories (or labels) associated with the article text.\n\nTraining models work better on clean data.  For example, capitalization and punctuation can degrade fastText results.  We will preprocess the data in an Article Cleaner process.\n\nThe clean data will be passed into fastText to train the classifier model.  The test file will be used to validate the training model.  Training parameters will be tweaked here to improve accuracy while maintaining reasonable performance.\n\n#### RSS Feeds\n\nEventually we will seed our RSS Web Crawler process with the Alexa Top 1 Million Domains.  Initially however, we will probably test by crawling a blog hosting site like Blogger.  We should filter out RSS feeds by downloading them and checking last posted date and content length.  This will favor blogs that post full article content over summary blogs.  This is necessary so that we have enough content to make a category (label) prediction about the feed.\n\n#### Feed Database\n\nOur Labeled Feed Database will be generated by the RSS Prediction Processor.  This process will call out to fastText to get a prediction of which categories match the RSS feed.  It will also extract RSS feed metadata.  This information will be combined to generate an output database of labeled (categorized) feed information.\n\nThe database should allow for being used as a way to browse by category (label).  It should also allow for full text searching of Feed title and/or category.\n\n#### Search Results\n\nThe Labeled Feed Database should be able to be embedded in a client application.  An RSS Reader is a prime example of where this could be used.  A user interface should allow users to search the database, find feeds, and subscribe to them.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis high level overview should give you an idea of what we will build and how much work is involved.  There is room for improvement.  For example, the Labeled Feed Database is just a text search / browsing database.  There might be something we could do with Machine Learning to better match search criteria with the labeled feeds.\n\nNow on to implementing, iterating, and learning.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since we wanted to stay close to Phoenix while we waited for our heater parts to come in, we went to the closest free campsite.  Since is was close to the Phoenix suburbs, I expected the campsite to be crowded and it was.  The campsite in total was less than the size of a football field and everyone was right on top of each other.  The ground was uneven and in the center was pool of rancid water.  It turns out this was the trailhead for a popular horse trail, which explained the large piles of horse shit everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>I try to make friends when we are camping around other people.  If folks like you, they will look out for your stuff when you aren&rsquo;t around.  They are also much more likely to lend a helping hand if you need it.</p>\n\n<p>We were camped (parked) next to a fellow in a minivan.  He had a table set up and was grilling polish sausages on it.  I waved to him and he apologized for all the smoke he was creating.  I told him that it smelled good and not to worry about it.  He offered me a sample and I ate it.  He then told me he&rsquo;d gotten the sausages cheap and that it was dinner for his three dogs.  I wondered if I was going to get sick from eating this bargain basement sausage as I looked over this man&rsquo;s camp.  He was clearly wasted, hadn&rsquo;t washed or changed for at least a week, and there were beer bottles laying every where.</p>\n\n<p>We chatted and I let him know that we had just recently gotten to Arizona.

				"content_text": "Since we wanted to stay close to Phoenix while we waited for our heater parts to come in, we went to the closest free campsite.  Since is was close to the Phoenix suburbs, I expected the campsite to be crowded and it was.  The campsite in total was less than the size of a football field and everyone was right on top of each other.  The ground was uneven and in the center was pool of rancid water.  It turns out this was the trailhead for a popular horse trail, which explained the large piles of horse shit everywhere.\n\nI try to make friends when we are camping around other people.  If folks like you, they will look out for your stuff when you aren't around.  They are also much more likely to lend a helping hand if you need it.\n\nWe were camped (parked) next to a fellow in a minivan.  He had a table set up and was grilling polish sausages on it.  I waved to him and he apologized for all the smoke he was creating.  I told him that it smelled good and not to worry about it.  He offered me a sample and I ate it.  He then told me he'd gotten the sausages cheap and that it was dinner for his three dogs.  I wondered if I was going to get sick from eating this bargain basement sausage as I looked over this man's camp.  He was clearly wasted, hadn't washed or changed for at least a week, and there were beer bottles laying every where.\n\nWe chatted and I let him know that we had just recently gotten to Arizona.  He proceeded to give me tips on the best places to go and when to go there.  He'd been living on the road for quite a while and spent a deal of time living cheap in Arizona.

				"content_html": "<p>Branching Strategies are controversial.  Why is that?  Why can’t we just pick a strategy like <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow\">Git Flow</a> and call it the one true way to do branching?  The answer is that software development is too complicated for a one size fits all approach.  Factors that can impact how you do branching:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is your team remote?</li>\n<li>Do all contributors have the same level of repository access?</li>\n<li>Is the project an open source project?</li>\n<li>Are there multiple products being produced from this repository?</li>\n<li>Are you doing Agile development?</li>\n<li>Is there a comprehensive automated test suite?</li>\n<li>What tools are you using to manage source control?</li>\n<li>Does your project have core values regarding quality?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>NetNewsWire</h2>\n<p>What I am going to propose in this post is a minimalist branching strategy designed to fit the NetNewsWire project.</p>\n<p>NetNewsWire is a small, open source project.  It has a small core team that is trusted with full repository access.  It has additional developers that contribute via repository forks and pull requests.  Everyone is remote.  There are two main products produced, an iOS app and a macOS app.  The two products share code that should be kept in the same repository.  There isn’t a comprehensive automated test suite.  It has a stated project goal of zero known bug releases.  There is a desire to ensure that the release process doesn't impede development.  Source control is done in Git and dependency management is done using Git submodules.</p>\n<h2>Three-Flow</h2>\n<p>The branching strategy I am going to recommend is an implementation of <a href=\"https://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2017/04/09/a-different-branching-strategy/\">Three-Flow,</a> a <a href=\"https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/\">Trunk Based Development</a> strategy.  Do not read about Three-Flow right now. I’m going to give you an executive summary of Three-Flow and apply it to NetNewsWire. Besides the Three-Flow post has a lot of scary git commands and it specifically says it won’t work for a project like NetNewsWire.  By itself it won’t, but it is a good foundation to start from.</p>\n<p>(A lot of NetNewsWire development is done using Git forks and pull requests.  This branching strategy accommodates that workflow, but I won’t be addressing it in this post.  This post will focus on how development is managed for the developers with full repository access.)</p>\n<p>Three-Flow uses 3 branches to facilitate development, stabilize a release, and manage production hotfixes.  Development happens on Master and moves to a branch called Candidate when it is ready to be stabilized.  Development continues on Master and bug fixes to the release candidate happen on Candidate.  When the product is released, it is pushed to the Release branch. Hotfixes can happen on the Release branch.  All bugs found and fixed are back merged to Candidate and then Master respectively.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Branching.png\" src=\"https://vincode.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8751e5ec42.jpg\" alt=\"Branching\" width=\"597\" height=\"147\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>All arrows going up are promotions (pushes) to the next environment.  All arrows going down are back ports of bugfixes.</p>\n<p>That is Three-Flow applied to NetNewsWire.  It would be that simple, but we have two products we are going to deliver from the same repository.  The iOS and the macOS variants of NetNewsWire.  To stabilize and manage both variants, each will need to be given their own Candidate and Release branches.  </p>\n<p><img title=\"Branching Full.png\" src=\"https://vincode.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5ed634625e.jpg\" alt=\"Branching Full\" width=\"598\" height=\"241\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today (6/2/2019) we would need 2 branches, Master and macOS Candidate, in the main repository which will eventually grow to be 5 branches.  There will also be a number of repository forks that NetNewWire developers will create to do bug fixes and implement new features (not shown here).</p>\n<h2>Tagging</h2>\n<p>Each release should be tagged using <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a>.  Candidates will continue to be tagged using the current convention which denotes the difference between developer, alpha and beta releases.  Additionally, we will need to use a convention to avoid tag name collisions between iOS and macOS products.  macOS will use even minor release numbers and iOS will use odd minor release numbers.  (See the above diagram for examples.)</p>\n<h2>Submodules</h2>\n<p>NetNewsWire uses Git submodules to manage project dependencies.  All the submodules are under the same project umbrella as NetNewWire and there are no third party dependencies to manage.  These submodules are mostly stable at this point.  For simplicity sake, all development on the submodules will continue on their repository Master branch.  These submodules won’t be managed as separate projects with separate releases/tags at this time.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>There are 3 types of branches: Master, Candidate, and Release.  All feature development happens on Master.  Stabilization happens on Candidate.  Hotfixes happen on Release.  Each product gets its own Candidate and Release branches.  All candidates and releases get tagged.</p>\n<p>I feel this system is as simple as it can be, but not any simpler.  The complexity built into this system buys us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to release for 2 platforms</li>\n<li>Shared code stays in the same repository</li>\n<li>Time to stabilize releases</li>\n<li>Management of production releases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feedback is welcome.  We will be discussing this post in the <a href=\"https://netnewswire.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MDA1MjQzMDkzLTNlNjBhOWVhYzdhYjA4ZWFhMzQ1MTUxYjU0NTE5ZGY0YzYwZWJhNjYwNTNmNTg2NjIwYWY4YzhlYzk5NmU3ZTc\">NetNewsWire Slack</a> on the #work channel.</p>\n",

It is coming soon to the Mac and maybe someday to Android as well. Right now, you can find it <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bind-it/id1217961214?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">here</a> for $0.99 in the Apple App Store.</p>\n\n<p>Making a successful app takes a lot more than just writing good code. Here I write about what I did outside of Xcode to make Bind It.\n<h2>Product Development</h2>\nI frequently come across long form articles that I want to read, but either don’t have the time or want to save it for later. For me it was common to catch an article I wanted to read at work, but wanted to wait until I was off the clock to read it. Sometimes I had a long wait while getting my oil changed or at the doctor’s office and wanted to catch up on those saved articles.</p>\n\n<p>Bookmarks or leaving tabs open didn’t really work so well. Eventually, I ended up with a mess of bookmarks that I considered non-permanent and cluttered up my bookmarking system or I lost the tab I’d kept open for weeks.</p>\n\n<p>My brother lives in a cellular dead zone and if I was watching his kids for him, I had an opportunity to catch up on some reading, but no internet. Besides, articles disappear. They get deleted or moved behind a paywall on the internet. I didn’t know how soon I would get to an article and didn’t want to lose it if I took too long. I needed a solution that didn’t require a constant internet connection, kept my articles organized, and kept them perminantly.</p>\n\n<p>My wife had different needs that I wrote Bind It for. She likes to read amateur horror stories from a subreddit called <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep\">Nosleep</a>. Some of them are long and she would often lose track of ones she wanted to finish. She also uses the Reddit iPhone app to read them and the text in it is small and hard on the eyes.</p>\n\n<p>eBooks are packages of text and images that are portable. eBook readers, like iBooks, allow you to store these eBooks, manage them, and view them. The reader will scale the text for you and even allow for different viewing themes that work better for day vs. night. eBook readers work to reduce eye strain.</p>\n\n<p>What we needed was an app that created an eBook on the fly from a web page. It needed to figure out which images and text were important. It needed to search for and throw away ads and user comments at the bottom of articles.\n<h2>Branding</h2>\nI had originally named the app Book It, which I think is a little catchier. It was so catchy that an online booking company had already caught it. Book binding in the digital world is really what Bind It is doing, so I changed the name to Bind It. As a bonus, the logo I had created for it still worked. I’m mostly happy with the name and logo.</p>\n\n<p>My software companies name also needed to be updated. Vineyard Enterprise Software, Inc worked well enough for the name of the staff augmentation company I started in the 90’s, but didn’t really stand up well now that I focus on web and mobile development. Vincode is shorter and easier to remember, so I trademarked it. It fits the modern web and mobile world better. Apple doesn’t allow you to use tradenames, so until I formally change the name of the company it will show up as the longer, older name for now.\n<h2>Advertising</h2>\nA decent idea, app, logo, and name aren’t enough to get any traction in the App Store. You must buy advertising. At $0.99 per sale, of which Apple passes $0.70 to me, spending a lot on advertising isn’t viable.</p>\n\n<p>My current plan is to run a trial advertising campaign on the amateur story subreddits, like Nosleep, to target them specifically. The readers of these subreddits are one of the main two use cases for Bind It, so hopefully conversions will be decent. At $1 per 1000 impressions, it should be affordable too. Based on the initial trial marketing campaign on Reddit, I might roll the campaign out to other short story sites on the web. If anyone has a site that they think would work well with Bind It, let me know. I’ll make sure Bind It works for it and may help support it with advertising.\n<h2>Web Presence</h2>\nYou must have a website these days and it needs to look professionally designed. I settled on Wordpress as the content management solution for my sites. It is extremely popular with over 25% of the web sites running it. I chose it solely for its popularity, but I was pleasantly surprised dug under the hood to start working with it. There are a lot of themes that are very professional looking to get started with. Making professional sites dynamic functionality is trivial if you have been building dynamic sites for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I registered <a href=\"https://vincode.io/\">vincode.io</a> since it is common to use the “io” top level domain for tech companies these days and vincode.com was already registered.\n<h2>Social</h2>\nI created a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vincode.io\">Facebook page for Bind It</a>. I don’t expect much to be going on over there, but it was easy to create and it lets people in my life have a glimpse into what I do for a living.</p>\n\n<p>This article will also appear on LinkedIn. I’m hopeful that posting on LinkedIn will get a handful of early adopters during the initial soft rollout. This will find more bugs before I start advertising could head off some negative reviews when I ramp up marketing. I’ve already put out two revisions of the app based on early testing.</p>\n\n<p>If any significant social activity springs up around Bind It, it will most likely be on Reddit since I plan on advertising there. I created a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/binditapp/\">Bind It subreddit</a> where I can get feedback from people. Hopefully participation will be higher there since the people I advertise to will likely already have a Reddit account to post under.</p>\n\n<p>The social game for Bind It is a little weak. This is an area that I plan to continue to work on.\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nI wrote Bind It because it filled a need that I personally had. I want other people to use it as well so I put a lot of effort into the business side of app development. Give it a try.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><h2>The Beginning and Facebook Drama</h2>\n<p>With all the drama from this car getting stolen, I thought I would let everyone know why I bought a 1974 VW Beetle when I am downsizing and planning on living in a van.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-125\" src=\"https://vincode.micro.blog/uploads/2019/7f8f2692a9.jpg\" alt=\"/Users/maurice/Desktop/IMG_1563.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>For those who missed it or aren’t Facebook friends with me, about a week ago I bought a classic VW Bug. The doors didn’t have any keys, but I only paid $3,700 for the car so I didn’t expect anyone to risk going to jail to steal it. It is probably about the cheapest car in my apartment parking lot, so I figured a different car would be targeted first. Wrong. I got home from having lunch with my friend Jerry and it was gone.</p>\n<p>I should have realized that the car stood out and may be worth more than I paid for it. The first time I bought gas, I was approached by someone who wanted to talk about it. My apartment manager half-jokingly offered to trade me her ’06 black Beetle for it. I parked in front of Dunkin Donuts to get a coffee. The girl who got me a cream donut and coffee had that glitter in her eye and flirty welcoming smile that could melt any man’s heart. I half expected the bug to wink back at her and for them to leave together. Everyone loves that car.</p>\n<p>I put a post on Facebook and asked everyone to share it so that if someone saw it they could call 911 and report it. A good friend, Vicky, posted it to her neighborhood group. Vicky and I both live in the Little Italy district in Omaha and someone in her group saw that it was only a few blocks from my house.

				"content_text": "<h2>The Beginning and Facebook Drama</h2>\n<p>With all the drama from this car getting stolen, I thought I would let everyone know why I bought a 1974 VW Beetle when I am downsizing and planning on living in a van.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-125\" src=\"https://vincode.micro.blog/uploads/2019/7f8f2692a9.jpg\" alt=\"/Users/maurice/Desktop/IMG_1563.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>For those who missed it or aren’t Facebook friends with me, about a week ago I bought a classic VW Bug. The doors didn’t have any keys, but I only paid $3,700 for the car so I didn’t expect anyone to risk going to jail to steal it. It is probably about the cheapest car in my apartment parking lot, so I figured a different car would be targeted first. Wrong. I got home from having lunch with my friend Jerry and it was gone.</p>\n<p>I should have realized that the car stood out and may be worth more than I paid for it. The first time I bought gas, I was approached by someone who wanted to talk about it. My apartment manager half-jokingly offered to trade me her ’06 black Beetle for it. I parked in front of Dunkin Donuts to get a coffee. The girl who got me a cream donut and coffee had that glitter in her eye and flirty welcoming smile that could melt any man’s heart. I half expected the bug to wink back at her and for them to leave together. Everyone loves that car.</p>\n<p>I put a post on Facebook and asked everyone to share it so that if someone saw it they could call 911 and report it. A good friend, Vicky, posted it to her neighborhood group. Vicky and I both live in the Little Italy district in Omaha and someone in her group saw that it was only a few blocks from my house. Luckily I was able to retrieve car with only minor damage to the ignition lock. It is now securely in a garage awaiting an electronic alarm.</p>\n<h2>Internal Conflict</h2>\n<p>Now it is time for me to come clean. My plan for the car is to turn it into a bugeye Baja Bug.
