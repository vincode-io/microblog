				"content_html": "<p>For the past 8 months or os, I&rsquo;ve been working on a new app called <a href=\"https://zavala.vincode.io/\">Zavala</a>. It&rsquo;s a modern take on a traditional outliner app.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is a pretty decent app, considering it was developed by a single person over 8 months. It isn&rsquo;t easy making an app that runs on 3 different platforms and does syncing and collaboration across those platforms. To give credit where due, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without some recent enhancements to Apple&rsquo;s API&rsquo;s. Catalyst and CloudKit are big advantages that I have that developers 5 years ago didn&rsquo;t have. Check out the full feature list <a href=\"https://zavala.vincode.io/features/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I am particularly proud of is how the UI is animated. Adding and removing rows isn&rsquo;t jarring and gives a solid feel to the application. For example if you are collaborating on an outline with another user, if they insert a row, the outline opens where the row goes and puts it there. There is never a situation where everything just blinks and stuff is in different locations.</p>\n\n<p>The next version, 1.1, will support images embedded into the text of the outline. It will also support some other commands that other outliners usually support. I&rsquo;ll be adding keyboard shortcuts for moving a row up or down in the outline. I&rsquo;ll also be adding a way to add rows below, either indented or outdented. I hope to have this release out by Fall.</p>\n\n<p>Version 2 will be coming much later and will require macOS 12 and iOS 15. This is so that I can take advantage the latest in automation API&rsquo;s. With Shortcuts now on the Mac, the path forward for automation on Apple&rsquo;s platforms is clear. I plan to make Zavala&rsquo;s Shortcuts capabilities very robust so that custom workflows and integration with other apps is first class. I&rsquo;m very excited to see how users automate Zavala in the future.</p>\n\n<p>If you are into outliners, you should give Zavala a try. It is free and Open Source and will be forever, so you have nothing to lose. If you are into task managers or note taking you should give outliners a try. You might be surprised at how creating hierarchies of that information is useful.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reading and a lot of soul searching lately.  Having to dig deep into Machine Learning wasn&rsquo;t on my 2020 list of things to do.  I&rsquo;d really planned to spend this year improving my Apple platforms developer skills.  Learning Python and a bunch of new concepts is a real detour for me.</p>\n\n<p>To better understand if the Machine Learning was something I wanted go ahead with, I did some research on how much education you needed to get into it.  It turns out there is quite a bit to it, but there is also a good deal of overlap with my existing skillset.  For example, my business programming career left me with lots of skill manipulating and cleansing large amounts of data programmatically.  That and being able to program at all are good starting points.</p>\n\n<p>The other big prerequisites are math.  Specifically linear algebra, statistics, and probabilities. I used to know how to do that stuff, but that was 30 years ago.  The good news is that the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org\">Khan Academy</a> has courses that I can take for refreshers.

				"content_text": "I've been doing a lot of reading and a lot of soul searching lately.  Having to dig deep into Machine Learning wasn't on my 2020 list of things to do.  I'd really planned to spend this year improving my Apple platforms developer skills.  Learning Python and a bunch of new concepts is a real detour for me.\n\nTo better understand if the Machine Learning was something I wanted go ahead with, I did some research on how much education you needed to get into it.  It turns out there is quite a bit to it, but there is also a good deal of overlap with my existing skillset.  For example, my business programming career left me with lots of skill manipulating and cleansing large amounts of data programmatically.  That and being able to program at all are good starting points.\n\nThe other big prerequisites are math.  Specifically linear algebra, statistics, and probabilities. I used to know how to do that stuff, but that was 30 years ago.  The good news is that the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) has courses that I can take for refreshers.

				"content_html": "<p>My first run at classifying blogs ended predictably bad.  Not horribly bad, I guess.  If you squint really hard, you could see that some of the categories kind of make some sense.  They just were generally not useful due to category vagueness.  The categories that were found were things like &ldquo;culture&rdquo; or &ldquo;humanities&rdquo; which could be almost anything.  Things are going to have to get more specific and more accurate.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I noticed when I was validating the categories and their relationships that I extracted was that some were missing.  It turns out that Wikipedia will use templates sometimes for categories.  A Wikipedia template is server-side include, if you know what that is.  Basically is a way to put one page inside another page.  I didn&rsquo;t have a way to include template contents in a page while I was parsing it and was missing categories because of it.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve started reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/fastText-Quick-Start-Guide-representation-ebook/dp/B07FNY4KH7/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=fasttext+book&amp;qid=1589489494&amp;sr=8-3\">fastText Quick Start Guide</a> and am about a &frac14; of the way through it.  I haven&rsquo;t learned much about NLP, but I have gotten more tools to play with now.  One of these is another Wikipedia extraction utility, <a href=\"https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor\">WikiExtractor</a> and it handles templates!</p>\n\n<p>Something I always do when looking at a new Github project is check out open issues and pull requests.  It tells you a lot about how well maintained the project is.  One open pull request for WikiExtractor is &ldquo;Extract page categories&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m glad I saw that pull request, because I didn&rsquo;t know that it didn&rsquo;t extract categories.  Also, I now had the code to extract those categories.  I grabbed the pull request version and got to work.</p>\n\n<p>I did a couple test runs and realized that although I was getting full template expanded articles with categories, I wasn&rsquo;t getting any category pages.  The category pages are how I build the relationships between categories.  WikiExtractor is about 3000 lines of Python, all in one file.  After a couple hours of reading code, I was familiar enough with the program to modify it to only extract category pages and bypass article pages.  I&rsquo;ll extract the article pages later.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a new Category Extractor that took input from WikiExtractor and reloaded my categories database.  Success!  I now had the missing categories.  Before, I had about 1 million categories.  Now I have 1.8 million.  Due to this change and fixing some other bugs, my category relationship count went up from 550,000 entries to 3.1 million.  This is a lot higher fidelity information than I had loaded before.</p>\n\n<p>The larger database makes a problem I had earlier even harder now.  How to roll up categories into their higher level categories.  This was a poor performer before and now that I will be extracting articles again and assigning them categories, I&rsquo;m going to have to make it go faster.  It ran so slow that I only had 68,000 articles to train my model with and I want to use a lot more than that next time.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the next thing to work on.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;m running WikiExtractor against the full Wikipedia dump to give me template expanded articles.  This is running much slower than when I just extracted the category pages and may take a couple days to complete.  My poor laptop.  If I have to extract those articles more than once using WikiExtractor, I&rsquo;m going to set up a large Amazon On-Demand instance to run it on.  Hopefully, it won&rsquo;t come to that.</p>\n",

I didn't have a way to include template contents in a page while I was parsing it and was missing categories because of it.\n\nI've started reading [fastText Quick Start Guide](https://www.amazon.com/fastText-Quick-Start-Guide-representation-ebook/dp/B07FNY4KH7/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=fasttext+book&qid=1589489494&sr=8-3) and am about a 1/4 of the way through it.  I haven't learned much about NLP, but I have gotten more tools to play with now.  One of these is another Wikipedia extraction utility, [WikiExtractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor) and it handles templates!  \n\nSomething I always do when looking at a new Github project is check out open issues and pull requests.  It tells you a lot about how well maintained the project is.  One open pull request for WikiExtractor is \"Extract page categories\".  I'm glad I saw that pull request, because I didn't know that it didn't extract categories.  Also, I now had the code to extract those categories.  I grabbed the pull request version and got to work.\n\nI did a couple test runs and realized that although I was getting full template expanded articles with categories, I wasn't getting any category pages.  The category pages are how I build the relationships between categories.  WikiExtractor is about 3000 lines of Python, all in one file.  After a couple hours of reading code, I was familiar enough with the program to modify it to only extract category pages and bypass article pages.  I'll extract the article pages later.\n\nI wrote a new Category Extractor that took input from WikiExtractor and reloaded my categories database.  Success!  I now had the missing categories.  Before, I had about 1 million categories.  Now I have 1.8 million.  Due to this change and fixing some other bugs, my category relationship count went up from 550,000 entries to 3.1 million.  This is a lot higher fidelity information than I had loaded before.\n\nThe larger database makes a problem I had earlier even harder now.  How to roll up categories into their higher level categories.  This was a poor performer before and now that I will be extracting articles again and assigning them categories, I'm going to have to make it go faster.  It ran so slow that I only had 68,000 articles to train my model with and I want to use a lot more than that next time.\n\nThat's the next thing to work on.  In the meantime, I'm running WikiExtractor against the full Wikipedia dump to give me template expanded articles.  This is running much slower than when I just extracted the category pages and may take a couple days to complete.  My poor laptop.  If I have to extract those articles more than once using WikiExtractor, I'm going to set up a large Amazon On-Demand instance to run it on.  Hopefully, it won't come to that.\n",

This isn&rsquo;t easy because Wikipedia&rsquo;s categories aren&rsquo;t strictly hierarchal.  They kind of are, but it is really more of a graph than a hierarchy.  What I mean by this is that a specific article can have multiple top level categories and there are many paths to get there.  You can see this if you click on one of the categories at the bottom of a Wikipedia article.  It will take you to a page about that category and at the bottom of that page is more categories that this one belongs to.  Since there are more than one, the path to the top isn&rsquo;t obvious and is plural.</p>\n\n<p>One pitfall to walking a graph like this is getting stuck in a loop.  For example category A points to category B, which points to category C, which points to category A.  Another problem is getting back to too many top level categories.  Finally, you have to deal with the sheer number of paths that can be taken.  Say the category we are looking for has 5 parent categories and those have 5 each and those have 5 each.  That&rsquo;s 125 paths to search after only going up 3 levels.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I put code in to limit recursion, limited to 5 resulting categories, and only 4 levels of searching upwards.

It's a PostgreSQL front end written by some indie devs.  It's what Brent Simmons would call a [Mac-assed Mac app](https://inessential.com/2020/03/19/proxyman).\n\n<img src=\"https://vincode.io/uploads/2020/56552b895b.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020 05 18 at 5 56 35 PM\" title=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-18 at 5.56.35 PM.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"471\" />\n\nI've only been using it a couple days, but it has made my life much nicer while working with both DDL (data definition language) and DML (data manipulation language).  It was an easy decision to buy it.  It's only $40 if you get it from their site or $50 through the Mac App Store.\n\nSome days I can't but help to step back and marvel about where we are technologically in the developer world.  I used to work at companies that paid big money for Oracle or DB2 with their shitty Java based developer frontends.  Now I can have a high powered database for free, with a real AppKit front end for less than the price of a night out with my wife.  Good times.\n",

				"title": "CloudKit Impressions from a NetNewsWire Developer",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>I just got done implementing iCloud support in NetNewsWire.  We are still doing preliminary testing on it and aren’t ready for public testing.  I don’t know which release it will be in unfortunately.  That depends on how initial testing does and then public testing.</p>\n\n<p>I thought I’d write up some my initial impressions of CloudKit.  This isn’t a tutorial although you might find some of the information useful if you are looking to develop with CloudKit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"education-process\">Education Process</h2>\n\n<p>The process for learning any major technology from Apple seems to be about the same and I found CloudKit no different.  I read a couple blog posts on CloudKit when I got started.  Then I watched some old WWDC videos on it.  Then I searched Github for open source projects using it and read their code.  Then I implemented it while relying on the API docs.</p>\n\n<p>I found reading the code from an actual project to be most helpful.  A blog post and couple WWDC videos only get you to the point that you are dangerous to yourself and others.  CloudKit has some advanced error handling that needs to be implemented to work at all.  It is hard to pick that up from only a few sources.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"implementing-basic-sync\">Implementing basic sync</h2>\n\n<p>The hardest part about implementing the basic syncing process was leaving my relational database design knowledge behind.  A CloudKit record is not a table, even if superficially they look the same.</p>\n\n<p>This becomes very obvious when you look at how you can get only the items that have changed in a database since the last time you checked.  CloudKit has a feature that will return you only the changes to records that have been made which saves greatly on processing.  You don’t necessarily get those changes in an order that you can rely upon, so managing complex relationships between records isn’t recommended by me.  I ended up doing a couple things that went against all my training to get it to perform well.</p>\n\n<p>Once you figure out how to model your CloudKit data and understand the API’s, things fall together fairly quickly.  We have other RESTful services that do syncing in NetNewsWire, and CloudKit is the most simple implementation we have.</p>\n\n<p>One area that CloudKit outshines our RESTful service implementations is that it gets notifications when the data changes.  This keeps our data more up to date.  In the RESTful services, we sync which feeds you are subscribed to every so often via polling.  This happens at shortest around every 15 minutes.  Realtime updates to your subscription information isn’t necessary, but it is fun to add a feed on your phone and watch it appear in realtime on the desktop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"advanced-syncing-failure\">Advanced syncing failure</h2>\n\n<p>One thing I wanted to do was provide a centralized repository that knew which feeds had been updated and when.  I planned to have a system that would use the various NetNewsWire clients to update this data and notify the clients.  My theory was that checking one site for updated feeds would be faster than testing all the sites to see if their feeds had updated.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up giving up on this task.  I think it would have been possible to implement in CloudKit, but would not have been faster than checking all the sites for their feed updates.  You see, we can send out hundreds of requests to see if a feed has been updated all at the same time.  Typically they return back a 304 status code that says the weren’t updated and they don’t return any data at all.  This is very fast and all the site checks happen at the same time.  This is how the “On My Device” account works and it is very fast.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I couldn’t get CloudKit to work faster than checking all the sites individually comes down to one thing.  There is no such thing as a “JOIN” between CloudKit records.  If I could have connected data from more than one record per query I could have done some data driven logic.</p>\n\n<p>What I wanted to do was have one record type that contained information about all the feeds that NetNewsWire iCloud accounts were subscribed to.  This would contain the information about if the feed had been updated.  I needed to join this to another record type that had an individuals feeds so that I could restrict the number of feeds that a user was checking for updates.</p>\n\n<p>I could have implemented something that didn’t use the “JOIN” concept, but it would have required lots of CloudKit calls.

				"content_text": "I just got done implementing iCloud support in NetNewsWire.  We are still doing preliminary testing on it and aren’t ready for public testing.  I don’t know which release it will be in unfortunately.  That depends on how initial testing does and then public testing.\n\nI thought I’d write up some my initial impressions of CloudKit.  This isn’t a tutorial although you might find some of the information useful if you are looking to develop with CloudKit.\n\n## Education Process\n\nThe process for learning any major technology from Apple seems to be about the same and I found CloudKit no different.  I read a couple blog posts on CloudKit when I got started.  Then I watched some old WWDC videos on it.  Then I searched Github for open source projects using it and read their code.  Then I implemented it while relying on the API docs.\n\nI found reading the code from an actual project to be most helpful.  A blog post and couple WWDC videos only get you to the point that you are dangerous to yourself and others.  CloudKit has some advanced error handling that needs to be implemented to work at all.  It is hard to pick that up from only a few sources.\n\n## Implementing basic sync\n\nThe hardest part about implementing the basic syncing process was leaving my relational database design knowledge behind.  A CloudKit record is not a table, even if superficially they look the same.\n\nThis becomes very obvious when you look at how you can get only the items that have changed in a database since the last time you checked.  CloudKit has a feature that will return you only the changes to records that have been made which saves greatly on processing.  You don’t necessarily get those changes in an order that you can rely upon, so managing complex relationships between records isn’t recommended by me.  I ended up doing a couple things that went against all my training to get it to perform well.\n\nOnce you figure out how to model your CloudKit data and understand the API’s, things fall together fairly quickly.  We have other RESTful services that do syncing in NetNewsWire, and CloudKit is the most simple implementation we have.\n\nOne area that CloudKit outshines our RESTful service implementations is that it gets notifications when the data changes.  This keeps our data more up to date.  In the RESTful services, we sync which feeds you are subscribed to every so often via polling.  This happens at shortest around every 15 minutes.  Realtime updates to your subscription information isn’t necessary, but it is fun to add a feed on your phone and watch it appear in realtime on the desktop.\n\n## Advanced syncing failure\n\nOne thing I wanted to do was provide a centralized repository that knew which feeds had been updated and when.  I planned to have a system that would use the various NetNewsWire clients to update this data and notify the clients.  My theory was that checking one site for updated feeds would be faster than testing all the sites to see if their feeds had updated.\n\nI ended up giving up on this task.  I think it would have been possible to implement in CloudKit, but would not have been faster than checking all the sites for their feed updates.  You see, we can send out hundreds of requests to see if a feed has been updated all at the same time.  Typically they return back a 304 status code that says the weren’t updated and they don’t return any data at all.  This is very fast and all the site checks happen at the same time.  This is how the “On My Device” account works and it is very fast.\n\nThe reason I couldn’t get CloudKit to work faster than checking all the sites individually comes down to one thing.  There is no such thing as a “JOIN” between CloudKit records.  If I could have connected data from more than one record per query I could have done some data driven logic.\n\nWhat I wanted to do was have one record type that contained information about all the feeds that NetNewsWire iCloud accounts were subscribed to.  This would contain the information about if the feed had been updated.  I needed to join this to another record type that had an individuals feeds so that I could restrict the number of feeds that a user was checking for updates.\n\nI could have implemented something that didn’t use the “JOIN” concept, but it would have required lots of CloudKit calls.  This required me to pass the data I wanted to JOIN in every call.  It would have been unnecessarily complex and not performed better than just checking the site.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI think that CloudKit is amazing for what it is intended to do.  That is syncing data between devices.  I think it has potential to do more and I’ll be watching to see if Apple extends its capabilities in the future.  There may be more yet that we do with CloudKit on NetNewsWIre.\n",

I’m going to give you an executive summary of Three-Flow and apply it to NetNewsWire.

It is coming soon to the Mac and maybe someday to Android as well. Right now, you can find it <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bind-it/id1217961214?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">here</a> for $0.99 in the Apple App Store.</p>\n\n<p>Making a successful app takes a lot more than just writing good code. Here I write about what I did outside of Xcode to make Bind It.\n<h2>Product Development</h2>\nI frequently come across long form articles that I want to read, but either don’t have the time or want to save it for later. For me it was common to catch an article I wanted to read at work, but wanted to wait until I was off the clock to read it. Sometimes I had a long wait while getting my oil changed or at the doctor’s office and wanted to catch up on those saved articles.</p>\n\n<p>Bookmarks or leaving tabs open didn’t really work so well. Eventually, I ended up with a mess of bookmarks that I considered non-permanent and cluttered up my bookmarking system or I lost the tab I’d kept open for weeks.</p>\n\n<p>My brother lives in a cellular dead zone and if I was watching his kids for him, I had an opportunity to catch up on some reading, but no internet. Besides, articles disappear. They get deleted or moved behind a paywall on the internet. I didn’t know how soon I would get to an article and didn’t want to lose it if I took too long. I needed a solution that didn’t require a constant internet connection, kept my articles organized, and kept them perminantly.</p>\n\n<p>My wife had different needs that I wrote Bind It for. She likes to read amateur horror stories from a subreddit called <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep\">Nosleep</a>. Some of them are long and she would often lose track of ones she wanted to finish. She also uses the Reddit iPhone app to read them and the text in it is small and hard on the eyes.</p>\n\n<p>eBooks are packages of text and images that are portable. eBook readers, like iBooks, allow you to store these eBooks, manage them, and view them. The reader will scale the text for you and even allow for different viewing themes that work better for day vs. night. eBook readers work to reduce eye strain.</p>\n\n<p>What we needed was an app that created an eBook on the fly from a web page. It needed to figure out which images and text were important. It needed to search for and throw away ads and user comments at the bottom of articles.\n<h2>Branding</h2>\nI had originally named the app Book It, which I think is a little catchier. It was so catchy that an online booking company had already caught it. Book binding in the digital world is really what Bind It is doing, so I changed the name to Bind It. As a bonus, the logo I had created for it still worked. I’m mostly happy with the name and logo.</p>\n\n<p>My software companies name also needed to be updated. Vineyard Enterprise Software, Inc worked well enough for the name of the staff augmentation company I started in the 90’s, but didn’t really stand up well now that I focus on web and mobile development. Vincode is shorter and easier to remember, so I trademarked it. It fits the modern web and mobile world better. Apple doesn’t allow you to use tradenames, so until I formally change the name of the company it will show up as the longer, older name for now.\n<h2>Advertising</h2>\nA decent idea, app, logo, and name aren’t enough to get any traction in the App Store. You must buy advertising. At $0.99 per sale, of which Apple passes $0.70 to me, spending a lot on advertising isn’t viable.</p>\n\n<p>My current plan is to run a trial advertising campaign on the amateur story subreddits, like Nosleep, to target them specifically. The readers of these subreddits are one of the main two use cases for Bind It, so hopefully conversions will be decent. At $1 per 1000 impressions, it should be affordable too. Based on the initial trial marketing campaign on Reddit, I might roll the campaign out to other short story sites on the web. If anyone has a site that they think would work well with Bind It, let me know. I’ll make sure Bind It works for it and may help support it with advertising.\n<h2>Web Presence</h2>\nYou must have a website these days and it needs to look professionally designed. I settled on Wordpress as the content management solution for my sites. It is extremely popular with over 25% of the web sites running it. I chose it solely for its popularity, but I was pleasantly surprised dug under the hood to start working with it. There are a lot of themes that are very professional looking to get started with. Making professional sites dynamic functionality is trivial if you have been building dynamic sites for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I registered <a href=\"https://vincode.io/\">vincode.io</a> since it is common to use the “io” top level domain for tech companies these days and vincode.com was already registered.\n<h2>Social</h2>\nI created a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vincode.io\">Facebook page for Bind It</a>. I don’t expect much to be going on over there, but it was easy to create and it lets people in my life have a glimpse into what I do for a living.</p>\n\n<p>This article will also appear on LinkedIn. I’m hopeful that posting on LinkedIn will get a handful of early adopters during the initial soft rollout. This will find more bugs before I start advertising could head off some negative reviews when I ramp up marketing. I’ve already put out two revisions of the app based on early testing.</p>\n\n<p>If any significant social activity springs up around Bind It, it will most likely be on Reddit since I plan on advertising there. I created a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/binditapp/\">Bind It subreddit</a> where I can get feedback from people. Hopefully participation will be higher there since the people I advertise to will likely already have a Reddit account to post under.</p>\n\n<p>The social game for Bind It is a little weak. This is an area that I plan to continue to work on.\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nI wrote Bind It because it filled a need that I personally had. I want other people to use it as well so I put a lot of effort into the business side of app development. Give it a try.</p>\n",

They worked great in my condo and I had a really beefy inverter to power it, so I should have been fine. Unfortunately, the heater cut itself off after a few minutes of working. The heater was rather old and these things die periodically, so I trashed it and replaced it with a newer model from a Wisconson Walmart.</p>\n<p>It was about 4:30 in the morning when I finally had to stop for gas. The gas station was out in the middle of nowhere and was mostly abandoned except for a single clerk.

I must have ran over something in the parking lot of this shit hole station.</p>\n<p>Since I was stuck until a tire shop opened, I figured I’d wait until morning to call AAA. I got the new heater out and plugged in. It didn’t work at all. Figuring that the inverter wasn’t strong enough, I set up the generator and plugged the heater directly into it. The heater immediately cut out.</p>\n<p>I was cold, tired, and feeling inadequate because I couldn’t keep my weird little family warm.

The doors didn’t have any keys, but I only paid $3,700 for the car so I didn’t expect anyone to risk going to jail to steal it. It is probably about the cheapest car in my apartment parking lot, so I figured a different car would be targeted first. Wrong. I got home from having lunch with my friend Jerry and it was gone.</p>\n<p>I should have realized that the car stood out and may be worth more than I paid for it. The first time I bought gas, I was approached by someone who wanted to talk about it. My apartment manager half-jokingly offered to trade me her ’06 black Beetle for it. I parked in front of Dunkin Donuts to get a coffee. The girl who got me a cream donut and coffee had that glitter in her eye and flirty welcoming smile that could melt any man’s heart. I half expected the bug to wink back at her and for them to leave together. Everyone loves that car.</p>\n<p>I put a post on Facebook and asked everyone to share it so that if someone saw it they could call 911 and report it. A good friend, Vicky, posted it to her neighborhood group. Vicky and I both live in the Little Italy district in Omaha and someone in her group saw that it was only a few blocks from my house. Luckily I was able to retrieve car with only minor damage to the ignition lock. It is now securely in a garage awaiting an electronic alarm.</p>\n<h2>Internal Conflict</h2>\n<p>Now it is time for me to come clean. My plan for the car is to turn it into a bugeye Baja Bug.

I hadn’t expected to buy such a nice Beetle. The car I bought only has only minor surface rust on the pan. The interior is in better shape than my Corvette’s. It has 65,000 miles on the odometer, that I naturally disregarded for a car that old. After closely inspecting the car, there is a good chance that number is accurate. Replacing the engine, transmission, suspension and about half of the bodywork and interior feels… just wrong. When I told my brother, the plan he had an open look of disgust on his face that mirrored my own gut feeling.</p>\n<p>If you try hard enough, you can justify any bad behavior to yourself. I just keep telling myself that by “donating” the parts I remove on eBay, that there will be many more complete bugs in the world for it. In fact, by putting more bugs in the world, I’m doing God’s own work. Or is that <a href=\"http://www.vsvwa.freeservers.com/bughist2.html\">Hitler’s own work</a>?

				"title": "Burnout",
				"content_html": "<p>For those who don’t know, I lost my mind in the summer of 2015. As I told a friend who asked if this came suddenly, “No, this was a long time coming.” I had been trying to fight off anxiety and depression using alcohol and willpower for quite a while, but that only works for so long. At the time, I didn’t know that I had limits to the amount of stress that I could handle and I piled it on recklessly. In the end, I burned out and had a mental breakdown that left me unable and unwilling to work in my profession as a Software Architect.</p>\n<p>A contributing factor may have been my age, at the time 43 in years. Was it a midlife crisis?  Couldn't be right?  After all I didn’t have difficult children, crippling debt, or a loveless marriage. I already had a motorcycle, a red corvette, and a hot younger woman. I should have been safe. Regardless, I still wanted to run away and live a life of solitude as many men do at this age.  In the end I chalked my breakdown to hereditary major depressive disorder.  There is something of a history of this on my maternal side of the family, so the theory is plausible.  Don't worry, I'm medicated now and doing fine.</p>\n<p>More and more I’m coming to realize that many of those who wander aren’t necessarily looking for something, but trying to avoid the world and all that comes with it. At the <a href=\"http://www.cheaprvliving.com/gatherings/\">Rubber Tramp Rendezvous</a> one woman stood at a group meeting and said that she no longer needed anxiety medication since hitting the road.

				"content_text": "<p>For those who don’t know, I lost my mind in the summer of 2015. As I told a friend who asked if this came suddenly, “No, this was a long time coming.” I had been trying to fight off anxiety and depression using alcohol and willpower for quite a while, but that only works for so long. At the time, I didn’t know that I had limits to the amount of stress that I could handle and I piled it on recklessly. In the end, I burned out and had a mental breakdown that left me unable and unwilling to work in my profession as a Software Architect.</p>\n<p>A contributing factor may have been my age, at the time 43 in years. Was it a midlife crisis?  Couldn't be right?  After all I didn’t have difficult children, crippling debt, or a loveless marriage. I already had a motorcycle, a red corvette, and a hot younger woman. I should have been safe. Regardless, I still wanted to run away and live a life of solitude as many men do at this age.  In the end I chalked my breakdown to hereditary major depressive disorder.  There is something of a history of this on my maternal side of the family, so the theory is plausible.  Don't worry, I'm medicated now and doing fine.</p>\n<p>More and more I’m coming to realize that many of those who wander aren’t necessarily looking for something, but trying to avoid the world and all that comes with it. At the <a href=\"http://www.cheaprvliving.com/gatherings/\">Rubber Tramp Rendezvous</a> one woman stood at a group meeting and said that she no longer needed anxiety medication since hitting the road.
